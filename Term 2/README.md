Things to do: 
1. Check whether we can find the past marketcap
2. Create 2 top10 CC(one with BTC, one without BTC)
3. Update portfolio weekly
4. Test the accuracy of the expected return calculated from CAPM regression with the actual return.
5. Calculate Alpha of the strategy (Step4&5 are to test whether CAPM also holds in the CC market) 
6. Add SMB factor
