Things to do: 
0. Convert raw CC data into csv file
1. Check whether we can find the past marketcap
2. Create 2 top10 CC(one with BTC, one without BTC)
3. Update portfolio weekly
4. Test the accuracy of the expected return calculated from CAPM regression with the actual return
5. Calculate Alpha of the strategy (Step4&5 are to test whether CAPM also holds in the CC market) 
6. Add SMB factor
7. Include Alpha, Beta, Information Ratio, Max drawdown, Calmar ratio, VaR, Omega ratio, Sortino ratio, and Tail ratio for portfolio evaluation
